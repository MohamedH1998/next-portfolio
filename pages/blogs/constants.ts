      I have finally landed a developer role and after sharing the news with
      some friends, I got questions about what I had done to land the role.
      Below I go into detail about my journey, covering most of the courses that
      I have completed along with the reasons why. The process seemed extremely
      mystified to me when I was starting out, hopefully this helps demystify
      the whole process. Content Is coding for me? Coding is for me, now what? I
      think I have a decent grasp on CS fundamentals, what kind of develoepr do
      I want to be? What should I learn and how? Networking and applying for
      roles Is coding for me? There were a few misconceptions I had when I was
      looking to start learning how to code, namely having to be a maths wiz,
      however, most courses don't require any sort of prerequisite knowledge. I
      stumbled across a Python course and decided to just do it without much
      thinking. Personally, I think this course was a great starting point as it
      required no prerequisite knowledge, and I found the Python syntax (the way
      the code is written) was beginner friendly as it is written quite
      similarly to English. Coding is for me, now what? After watching YouTube
      videos, reading blogs and posts on r/cscareerquestions about people who
      have made the transition into tech, one learning resource that kept coming
      up frequently was Harvards CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. This
      really changed the game for me. I was walked through fundamental computer
      science concepts at a very beginner friendly way, which I think served me
      well in my later courses. Additionally, the programming language issued in
      the course is C, which I think is a lot more difficult to grasp than
      languages like JavaScript and Python. But again, because of this, I found
      my transition into the languages that I am now using a lot easier because
      I started with C. [HIGHLY RECOMMEND]. 3. I think I have a decent grasp on
      computer science fundamentals, what kind of developer/engineer do I want
      to be? Software engineering/ developing is the most loaded term ever, I
      spent most of my time trying to decide what kind of developer I wanted to
      be, I had no idea how to choose between front-end dev, back-end dev,
      mobile dev, game dev, devOps…the list goes on (if none of this makes sense
      to you, dont worry). Most of the articles that I have read tell people to
      start here- find out what type of developer you want to be and learn the
      appropriate skills. I had a look at a list of different types of
      developers and eliminated the ones that I knew I did not want to become.
      From there, I had a look at the job requirements for as many entry-level
      ‘software related jobs I could find in my local area, identifying which
      technologies/coding languages were sought after the most. HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and Python were popping up time and time again. These are used
      in Web Development, and as I have come across numerous articles that
      stated Web Development to be the easiest point of entry into tech, I
      decided to take that route. This is a table I made on notion, noting the
      job title, tech stack and specific requirements along with the link to the
      job post (feel free to drop me message if you want the table to us for
      yourself). 4. Deciding on what to learn and how to learn it. Whilst there
      are a lot of free resources online, I felt that I would benefit a lot more
      if I bought a Udemy course, especially since I enjoyed the Python one so
      much. As I decided on the Web Development route, I looked for related
      courses, sorted by popularity and started a Web Developer Bootcamp after
      having compared it with job descriptions for web dev roles. Half-way
      through the course, I ended up getting really stuck at one section, and
      after rewatching all the lectures 3 times, I decided that should
      supplement this course with another Web Development Bootcamp. The contents
      are very similar and I wouldnt recommend doing both, I would probably just
      do the second (Dr Yu's course). Again, towards the middle of this course
      when the JavaScript was picking up, I felt as though I wasnt fully
      understanding what was going on. I then put the other two courses on pause
      and started a Complete JavaScript Course. An absolute gem if you want a
      solid understanding in JavaScript in my opinion. The instructor explains
      things very well, often coming back to them in future lectures and his use
      of diagrams in his lectures to help you visualise how systems/concepts
      work was really helpful [HIGHLY RECOMMEND]. 5. Networking and Applying for
      Roles Another commonly given advice is to apply for jobs before youre
      ready. Since I knew no one in the industry that I could turn to for advice
      etc, I thought that I could use the application process as a way of
      networking (sort of). I decided to start applying for jobs a lot earlier
      than when I thought I was ready and tried to use the interviews as a way
      of getting feedback on what I was doing. This way, I could ask employers
      exactly that they thought about the technologies/languages that I was
      learning, and what to learn next. The reasoning behind this was that:
      Worst case scenario: I get practical advice from someone hiring in the
      industry, which is invaluable. Best case scenario: I land a job. I tried
      to continue this process of applying for roles, asking what to improve/
      learn, improving/ learning, and then applying for jobs until it worked.
